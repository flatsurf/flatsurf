// code can turn such const references into read-only wrappers that hold on to
// the same data structure and therefore hold the source of the reference alive.
// In other words, instances of a type which opts for this storage model,
// behave like dereferenced shared pointers that can be turned into the
// equivalent of a shared_ptr<const T> internally.
