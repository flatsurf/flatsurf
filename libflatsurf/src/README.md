Implementation of the libflatsurf Library
=========================================

The `.cc` and `.icc` files here contain the actual implementation of the
libflatsurf library.

To understand how this library works, it's probably best to have a look at some
example usage in the [binder notebook](../../binder/Sample.libflatsurf.ipynb)
or in our [unit tests](../test) first.

To see the full API, you should have a look at the header files which reside in
[flatsurf/](./../flatsurf/).
