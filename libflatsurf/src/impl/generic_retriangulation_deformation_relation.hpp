/// ``InsertMarkedPointInFaceDeformationRelation``,
/// ``InsertMarkedPointInFaceDeformationRelation``. In principal, this
/// deformation could be built as a composition of these and their sections.
/// However, we sometimes create deformation through intermediate shifts which
/// have no effect on the final deformation. These shifts are necessary to
/// construct the codomain but they are not part of the resulting deformation,
/// i.e., points should not be mapped through these shifts. Therefore, we need
/// this deformation relation as a composition of other deformations while
/// ignoring certain parts of the composed deformation.
