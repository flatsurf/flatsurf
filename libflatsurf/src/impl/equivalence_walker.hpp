    // Pick a random half edge as the starting point and call it half edge 1.
    // Then walk the surface in a breadth-first search, labeling half edges as 2,
    // 3, ... as we find unlabeled ones. The sequence of half edges we see during
    // this walk is a code word for this surface. If we sort the code words and
    // pick the lexicographically largest one, then it uniquely describes this
    // surface combinatorially.

    // To speed things up we compute all the code words in parallel and discard
    // code words that are not the lexicographically largest immediately. As an
    // optimization we don't need to record the label of the edge we are
    // crossing since it just going to be smallest edge label we have seen so
    // far.

    // initial "walkers" that emit a code character in each of their steps. We
    // compare these characters and discard any character that is not minimal
    // und all the minimal walkers are completed. This yields the minimal code
