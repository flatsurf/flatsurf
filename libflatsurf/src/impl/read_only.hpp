// A read-only reference (feels like a shared pointer to a const object) of a
// type T that uses the ManagedMovable<T> pimpl.
// This allows objects to hold a reference to an object that is only movable
// and not copyable. They could of course just store a T* but then that would
// not keep the target alive. This construct does keep the target alive by
// implicitly holding on to the shared pointer that is used internally.

  // A clone of the object we are holding on to. Since T is not copyable, a
  // user cannot create two Ts pointing to the same object but internally we
  // can do this. While given a `T x` and a `ReadOnly<T>(x) y` we have that `&x
  // != &y.value`, we still get that `x == y.value` and in particular modifying
  // one, modifies the other.
  // One should think of this as an implicitly dereferenced shared pointer.
