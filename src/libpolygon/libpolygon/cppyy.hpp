// As of early 2019, cppyy does not appear to honour https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument-dependent_name_lookup for operators.
// So we need to declare the operator<< in the global namespace, otherwise cppyy is ignoring it in str() unfortunately.
// At the same time, we can not only declare the global operator as then boost's lexical_cast does not see it, strangely.
