A Python Interface to libflatsurf

EXAMPLES:

The translation surface coming from a square::

    >>> from pyflatsurf import Surface, flatsurf
    >>> R2 = flatsurf.Vector['long long']
    >>> square = Surface([[1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2]], [R2(1, 0), R2(0, 1), R2(1, 1)])

TESTS:

Pickling works::

    >>> from pickle import loads, dumps

    >>> v = R2(13, 37)
    >>> loads(dumps(v)) == v
    True

    >>> loads(dumps(square)) == square
    True
