intervalxt Change Log
=====================

.. current developments

v1.1.3
====================

**Fixed:**

* worked around a segfault during iteration of saddle connections by length from the Python interface due to https://bitbucket.org/wlav/cppyy/issues/271/next-implementation-does-not-respect
* segfault when iterating saddle connections by length from Python (a header was missing in cppyy.hpp)
* colinearity check in FlowDecomposition::parabolic



v1.1.2
====================

**Added:**

* convenience methods `decompose`, `cylinders`, `minimalComponents`, `undeterminedComponents` to `FlowDecomposition` Python object

**Changed:**

* printing of `FlowDecomposition` which now shows how the decomposition decomposes into cylinders, minimal, and undetermined components
* [gmpxxll](https://github.com/flatsurf/gmpxxll) is now required at build time for the integer interface of intervalxt

**Fixed:**

* `algebraic_ring` consistently returns a SageMath ring
* Adapted to changes in cppyythonizations 1.0.0
* `Lengths` for `mpz` and `mpq` which were broken because we returned a reference to a temporary in one place



v1.1.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* compilation with some versions of gcc (missing include)
* a performance problem in `makeUniqueLargeEdges` which showed up at times in unfoldings of polygons with exact-real coefficients



v1.1.0
====================

**Added:**

* Serialization for most basic types, i.e., everything but the FlowDecomposition types

**Fixed:**

* Chain::operator==



v1.0.3
====================

**Added:**

* a DOI badge to the README for citations

**Fixed:**

* some compiler warnings with very recent GCCs



v1.0.2
====================

**Added:**

* DOIs are now generated by [zenodo](https://zenodo.org)



v1.0.1
====================

**Added:**

* safety checks for rever deploy script

**Fixed:**

* configure now allows version 6 and 7 of fmt since we do not use any version specific features
